		<B>Sep 15, 2015 - AspPDF 3.4.0.2 Service Release Available</B>
		<blockquote>
		The new service release incorporates the following enhancements:
		<P>
		<UL>
		<li>In response to discovering a new rare class of PDF documents causing AspPDF to run out of memory and crash
		during PDF-to-image conversion, the PdfPage.<B>ToImage</B> method has been thoroughly optimized to improve performance and reduce RAM footprint.</li>
		<li>When encountering PDF documents with an invalid page width/height combination, the <B>ToImage</B> method used to throw the exception
		<i>Invalid page width and/or height</i>. Now it defaults to the US Letter page size without throwing an exception, and creates an entry
		in the built-in error log instead.</li>
		<li>A bug in the <B>Form Flattening</B> module responsible for occasionally drawing form field content in unexpected places has been fixed.
		The bug only affected a rare class of PDF forms with non-standard /Matrix entries.</li>
		<li>The PdfForm.<B>Modify</B> method has been enhanced to support a new parameter, <i>Reset=true</i>.
		This parameter is a shortcut for resetting the current graphics state for all pages of the document to help achieve 
		consistent output during form flattening.</li>
		<li>A new live demo, <A target="_new" HREF="http://www.support.persits.com/pdf/demo_flatten.asp"><B>Form Flattening</B></A>,
		has been added to demonstrate AspPDF's form flattening feature.</li>
		</UL>
		As always, upgrading is free for registered users.
		</blockquote>

		<P>


		<B>Jul 18, 2015 - AspPDF 3.4.0.1 Service Release Available</B>
		<blockquote>
		The service release contains the following important fixes and enhancements:
		<P>
		<UL>
		<li>A serious bug in the <B>CreateGraphicsFromPage</B> method introduced in a previous service release has been fixed.
		The bug caused incorrect content rendering when multiple source documents or pages were involved.</li>
		<li>A rare class of PDF documents with a non-standard font encoding has been discovered that caused AspPDF to enter an infinite loop and crash during PDF-to-image
		conversion. Support for these documents has been added, and the problem fixed.</li>
		<li>The HTML-to-PDF module has been enhanced to support CSS properties <B>background-size: cover</B> and <B>background-size: contain</B>.</li>
		<li>The PdfPage.<B>CreateTextbox</B> has been enhanced to support the field text color via the <i>Color</i> parameter.</li>
		</UL>
		Upgrading is free for registered users.
		</blockquote>

		<P>

		<B>May 25, 2015 - AspPDF 3.4 Released with Support for Client-Side Signing of Server-Side PDFs</B>
		<blockquote>
		AspPDF's digital signing functionality required that the PDF document being signed and the digital certificate
		used for signing be both accessible to the PdfDocument.<B>Sign</B> method. In most cases,
		this meant the private key had to be transferred to the server, which is often impossible or impractical
		for security reasons.
		<P>
		As of AspPDF v3.4 (and also AspEncrypt v2.9), the PDF being signed and the signer certificate's private key 
		no longer need to physically meet. The PDF never has to leave the sever, and the private key never needs to leave the user's
		workstation. Instead, the hash value being signed and the signature itself do all the travelling.
		<P>
		The new functionality is described in details in <A HREF="manual_08.html#8_4"><B>Section 8.4 - Client-Side Signing of Server-Side PDFs</B></A>.
		<P>
		It is also demonstrated by a new Live Demo #10b (IE run as Administrator is required):
		<P>
		<A TARGET="_new" HREF="https://www.support.persits.com/pdf/demo_clientsign.asp"><B>https://www.support.persits.com/pdf/demo_clientsign.asp</B></a>
		</blockquote>

		<P>


		<B>Mar 30, 2015 - AspPDF 3.3 Released with PDF/A Compliance</B>
		<blockquote>
		<P>
		Version 3.3 enables the creation of PDF/A-compliant documents. It also implements a fix in its PDF-to-Image module to improve performance.
		<P>

		The PDF/A format is a subset of the regular PDF format with certain features, deemed incompatible with long-term archival and storage of documents, removed. 
		Several enhancements and fixes have been added to AspPDF, as well as a new method, PdfDocument.<B>AddOutputIntent</B>, 
		to bring the documents it creates to the PDF/A-1b compliance level. 
		For more information on the PDF/A functionality, see the new <A HREF="manual_12.html#12_4"><B>Section 12.4 - PDF/A Support</B></A>.
		<P>
		In addition to this new feature, AspPDF 3.3 incorporates an improvement in its PDF-to-Image module that significantly reduces the conversion
		time for certain PDFs, especially those using AES encryption.
		<P>
		Upgrading is free for registered users.
		</blockquote>

		<B>Mar 01, 2015 - AspPDF 3.2.0.6 Service Release Available</B>
		<blockquote>
		A bug responsible for a crash (A trappable error C0000005) when trying to use the PdfDocument.<B>SendToPrinter</B> method under certain conditions has been fixed.
		<P>
		For reasons yet unknown, a 32-bit process attempting to call SendToPrinter on the 64-bit versions of Windows 2012 and Windows 8 
		fails with the error "Access is denied", while a 64-bit process works well.
		Previous versions of Windows are not affected. 
		<P>
		A bug in the error handling code caused the component to crash under the above conditions. Service Release 3.2.0.6 fixes the crash.
		However, the SendToPrinter method may still error out with the error
		<P>
		<font color="red"><b>DocumentProperties failed. The error was: Access is denied.</b></font> 
		<P>
		To successfully use the SendToPrinter method on Windows 2012 and Windows 8, the 64-bit version of AspPDF should be used. 
		For a 32-bit process to be able to call the 64-bit version of AspPDF, asppdf64.dll needs to be registered under Component (COM+) Services.

		<B>Feb 18, 2015 - AspPDF 3.2.0.5 Service Release Available</B>
		<blockquote>
		This service release incorporates a number of important fixes and enhancements in the PDF-to-Image and other modules.
		<UL>
		<li>A class of PDF documents has been discovered, all containing Chinese and/or Japanese characters, which failed
		to convert properly to images, with the Chinese/Japanese characters disappearing during the PDF-to-Image conversion.
		This problem has now been fixed:
		<P>
		<img src="images/chjap.png">
		</li>
		<P>
		<li>The PDF-to-Image module has been enhanced to handle unembedded fonts better. Previous versions
		would always replace an unembedded font with a Helvetica Type1 font regardless of the unembedded font's name, while the current version
		attempts to find a system TrueType font that matches the font's name for better conversion accuracy.</li>
		<P>
		<li>A bug causing the component to crash when calling the Page.ExtractText method twice on the same page has been fixed.</li>
		<P>
		<li>A bug in AspPDF has been discovered that causes new page content to disappear when the modified PDF is viewed in the Google Chrome browser
		(Adobe Acrobat and Reader viewers are not affected.) Several attempts to fix the bug have been made recently, but the fixes
		caused undesired side effects and had to be rolled back. We are confident that the current service release 
		is free of the "disappearing content" problem as well as all the side effects introduced previously while attempting to fix it.</li>

		<B>Oct 23, 2014 - AspPDF 3.2.0.1 Service Release Available</B>
		<blockquote>
		
		The service release incorporates two important enhancements:<BR>
		

		<UL>
		<li><B>Performance improvement in the Document Stitching module</B>.
		It has been pointed out by some of our clients that the <B>AppendDocument</B> method may take a very long time when dozens or hundreds 
		of documents are stitched together, and the processing time seems to grow quadratically with the number of documents being appended.
		This serious performance problem has been identified and fixed. The processing time is now O(n log n) vs. O(n<sup>2</sup>) in previous versions.</li>
		<P>
		<li>
		<B>Support for PDF417 Barcode-equipped government forms</B>.
		Some US government agencies such as the USCIS have started using barcode-equipped forms which allow a processing clerk to transfer the content
		of a paper form to the computer system instantly by scanning a 2-dimensional barcode residing on each page of the form and encoding the 
		form's field data. AspPDF now has the capability to programmatically fill out these forms and generate the PDF417 barcodes in strict
		accordance with the government specifications. This feature is described in

		<blockquote>
		The new version offers the following new features and enhancements:

		Once one or more template graphics are linked
		to a document via the AddTemplate method, these templates automatically become the background
		for some or all newly created pages of the document.
