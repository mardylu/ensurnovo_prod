<h4>Why is this link not working?</h4>

Throughout the AspPDF manual,
links to the code samples
such as <B>http://localhost/asppdf/manual_03/03_hello.asp</B>
are used. For these links to work, the following must be true:

<UL>
<LI>You are running IIS or PWS on your local machine.
<LI>You have the latest version of AspPDF installed.
<LI>Your local web server responds to the address http://localhost.
<LI>The virtual directory /AspPDF is added to your web server
pointing to the \Samples sub-directory of the AspPDF installation.
<LI>If this is an .aspx file, the .NET framework must also be installed.
</UL>

If necessary, replace the word "localhost" with the name/address of your server.
