	Any page of a PDF document contains a set of graphics operators that define
	the appearance of this page on computer screen, printer or any
	other device. Some operators define the current <i>graphics state</i>
	which includes the current color, current line width, etc. 
	Others define lines, shapes, curves and regions of various sorts
	by their coordinates. Still others display sequences of text characters,
	etc.
	<P>
	By default, all drawing on a page occurs in the <I>default user coordinate space</i>
	with the origin in the lower-left corner of the page. The positive <i>x</i>
	axis extends horizontally to the right, and the positive <i>y</i> axis vertically
	upwards, as in standard mathematical practice. The length of a unit along
	both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes is 1/72 inch.
	<P>
	The central notion in PDF drawing is a <i>path</i>, which is a composition of
	straight and curved line segments which may connect to one another or may be
	disconnected. 
	<P>
	A straight line is defined by two points - the current point and endpoint.
	A curved path segment is specified as a <i>Cubic Bezier Curve</i>. Such curves
	are defined by four points: the two endpoints (the current point P<sub>0</sub>
	and the final point P<sub>3</SUB>) and two control points P<sub>1</sub> and 
	P<sub>2</sub>. The curve does not, in general, pass through the control points:
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="images/04_curve.gif">
	<P>
	A path is made up of one or more disconnected subpaths, each comprising a sequence
	of connected segments.
	Typically, a subpath is defined by specifying its starting point,
	appending one or more segments to it, and then closing it
	by appending a straight line segment from the current point to the starting point of the subpath.
	<P>
	Once a path is defined, it is painted by <i>stroking</i>, <i>filling</i>, or both.

	<Blockquote>
	AspPDF implements drawing functionality via the <B>PdfCanvas</B> object.
	At least one instance of PdfCanvas is associated with every page and
	graphics object. To draw on the foreground of a page, the <B>Page.Canvas</B> property
	is used. To draw on the background, <B>Page.Background</B> is used. Both
	properties return separate instances of the PdfCanvas object.
	<P>

	a path made up of a single subpath and stroking it:

	<A NAME="4_3">
	<FONT COLOR="#C06000"><B>4.3 Filling Rules</B></FONT>
	<Blockquote>
	The <B>Fill</B> method used in the previous section paints
	the insides of all the subpaths of a current path, considered together.
	Any subpaths that are open are implicitly closed before being filled.
	<P>
	For a simple path, it is intuitively clear what region lies inside. However, for a
	more complex path -- for example, a path that intersects itself or has one subpath
	that encloses another -- the interpretation of "inside" is not always obvious. The
	path machinery uses one of two rules for determining which points lie inside a
	path: the nonzero winding number rule and the even-odd rule.
	<P>
	<B><U>4.3.1 Nonzero Winding Number Rule</U></B>
	<P>
	The nonzero winding number rule determines whether a given point is inside a
	path by conceptually drawing a ray from that point to infinity in any direction
	and then examining the places where a segment of the path crosses the ray. Starting
	with a count of 0, the rule adds 1 each time a path segment crosses the ray
	from left to right and subtracts 1 each time a segment crosses from right to left.
	After counting all the crossings, if the result is 0 then the point is outside the path;
	otherwise it is inside.
	<P>
	For simple convex paths, the nonzero winding number rule defines the inside
	and outside as one would intuitively expect. The more interesting cases are those
	involving complex or self-intersecting paths.
	For a path consisting of a five-pointed star, drawn with five connected straight
	line segments intersecting each other, the rule considers the inside to be the entire
	area enclosed by the star, including the pentagon in the center. For a path composed
	of two concentric circles, the areas enclosed by both circles are considered
	to be inside, provided that both are drawn in the same direction. If the circles are
	drawn in opposite directions, only the "doughnut" shape between them is inside,
	according to the rule; the "doughnut hole" is outside:
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="images/04_nonzero.gif">
	<P>
	<B><U>4.3.2 Even-Odd Rule</U></B>
	<P>
	An alternative to the nonzero winding number rule is the even-odd rule. This rule
	determines the "insideness" of a point by drawing a ray from that point in any
	direction and simply counting the number of path segments that cross the ray,
	regardless of direction. If this number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point
	is outside. This yields the same results as the nonzero winding number rule for
	paths with simple shapes, but produces different results for more complex
	shapes.
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="images/04_oddeven.gif">
	<P>
	To fill a path using the Even-Odd rule, the <B>Fill</B> and <B>FillStroke</B> methods 
	must be called with a True argument, as follows:

	<FONT COLOR="#C06000"><B>4.4 Managing Graphics State</B></FONT>
	<Blockquote>
	The PdfCanvas object provides properties and methods
	to define the current <i>graphics state</i> which 
	holds all major drawing parameters, such as the current 
	stoking and filling colors, color space, line width, line join style, and others.
	Many graphics state parameters can be specified via their respective
	designated properties and methods, such as <B>LineWidth</B>,
	as well as the universal <B>SetParams</B> method.
	<P>
	<B><u>4.4.1 Colors</u></B><P>

	The current stroking and filling colors are set via the <B>SetColor</B> 
	and <B>SetFillColor</B> methods, respectively. Both methods accept
	three RGB color components in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. For example,
	the code
	<P>
	<B>Page.Canvas.SetColor 0, 0, 1<BR>
	Page.Canvas.SetFillColor 1, 0, 0</B>
	<P>
	sets the current stroking color to blue and filling color to red. Alternatively, the current colors
	can be specified via a parameter string passed to 
	the <B>SetParams</B> method, for example:
	<P>
	<B>Page.Canvas.SetParams "color=blue; fillcolor=red"</B>
	<P>
	Both the stroking and filling colors are black by default.

	<P>

	In addition to setting the stroking and filling colors, the SetColor and SetFillColor methods also set the current <i>color space</i>
	to RGB. To switch to the CMYK color space and set CMYK colors for the stroking and filling operations, 
	the methods	<B>SetColorCMYK</B> and <B>SetFillColorCMYK</B> methods should be used, respectively.
	These methods expect 4 arguments: cyan, magenta, yellow and black components.
	<P>
	As of Version 2.5, AspPDF supports many additional color spaces besides RGB and CMYK. Advanced
	color spaces are described in <A HREF="manual_15.html">Chapter 15 - Color Spaces</A>.

	<P>

	<A NAME="4_4_2">
	<B><u>4.4.2 Line Width and Cap Style</u></B><P>
	<P>
	The current line width is set via the <B>LineWidth</B> property which is set
	to 1 by default. A line width can be a fractional number. Alternatively, 
	the line width can be specified via the SetParams method, as follows:
	<P>
	<B>Page.Canvas.SetParams "LineWidth=0.1"</B>
	<P>
	The Line Cap style specifies the shape to be used at the ends of open subpaths
	(and dashes, if any) when they are stoked. The Line Cap parameter
	can be set to one of three values:
	<P>
	Style 0: <i>Butt cap</i>. The stroke is squared off at the endpoint of the path. There is no
	projection beyond the end of the path. This is the default value.<P>
	Style 1: <i>Round cap</i>. A semicircular arc with a diameter equal to the line width is
	drawn around the endpoint and filled in.
	<P>
	Style 2: <i>Projecting square cap</i>. The stroke continues beyond the endpoint of the path
	for a distance equal to half the line width and is then squared off.
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="images/04_cap.gif">
	<P>
	The current Line Cap parameter is specified via the <B>LineCap</B> property, or
	via the SetParams method as follows:
	<P>
	<B>Page.Canvas.SetParams "LineCap=1"</B>

	<P>
	<A NAME="4_4_3">
	<B><u>4.4.3 Line Join Style and Miter Limit</u></B><P>
	The Line Join style specifies the shape to be used at the corners of paths that are
	stroked. The Line Join parameter can be set to one of three values:
	<P>
	Style 0: <I>Miter join</i>. The outer edges of the strokes for the two segments are extended
	until they meet at an angle. If the segments meet at
	too sharp an angle (as defined by the miter limit parameter described below), 
	a bevel join is used instead. This is the default style.<P>

	Style 1: <i>Round join</i>. A circle with a diameter equal to the line width is drawn around
	the point where the two segments meet and is filled in, producing a rounded
	corner.
	<P>
	Style 2: <i>Bevel join</i>. The two segments are finished with butt caps 
	and the resulting notch beyond the ends of the segments is filled with a triangle.
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="images/04_join.gif">
	<P>
	When two line segments meet at a sharp angle and mitered joins have been specified 
	as the line join style, it is possible for the miter to extend far beyond the
	thickness of the line stroking the path. The miter limit imposes a maximum on
	the ratio of the miter length to the line width. When the limit is
	exceeded, the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.
	The ratio of miter length to line width is directly related to the angle <i>alpha</i>
	between	the segments in user space by the formula
	<P>
	miterLength / lineWidth = 1 / sin( <i>alpha</i> / 2 )
	<P>
	The Line Join style and Miter Limit parameters can be specified via the
	<B>LineJoin</B> and <B>MiterLimit</B> properties, respectively,
	as well as the SetParams method,
	as follows:
	<P>
	<B>Page.Canvas.SetParams "LineJoin=0; MiterLimit=1.414"</B>
	<P>
	
	<A NAME="4_4_4">
	<B><u>4.4.4 Line Dash Pattern</u></B><P>
	The line dash pattern controls the pattern of dashes and gaps used to stroke paths.
	It is specified by a dash array and a dash phase. The dash array’s elements are
	numbers that specify the lengths of alternating dashes and gaps; the dash phase
	specifies the distance into the dash pattern at which to start the dash.
	By default, the dash value array is empty and dash phase is 0,
	which corresponds to a solid, unbroken line.
	<P>
	Dash array values and dash phase can only be specified via the <B>SetParams</B>
	method.  The following five calls to the SetParams method
	produce patterns displayed below:
	<P>
	<B>
	Page.Canvas.SetParams "Dash1=3; DashPhase=0"<BR>
	Page.Canvas.SetParams "Dash1=2; DashPhase=1"<BR>

	</B>
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="images/04_dash.gif">
	<P>

	<P>
	A transformation matrix specifies the relationship between two coordinate spaces.
	By modifying a transformation matrix, objects can be scaled, rotated, translated,

	<P>
	A transformation matrix in PDF is specified by an array of six numbers,
	[a b c d e f]. It can represent any linear transformation from one coordinate

	the same size as sx and sy units, respectively, in the previous coordinate system.
	<P>

	The <B>SaveState</B> method pushes a copy of the entire graphics state onto the stack.
	The <B>RestoreState</B> method restores the entire graphics state to its former value by popping
